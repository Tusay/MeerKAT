This folder contains my work on the MeerKAT database project.

- Headers is an excel spreadsheet of the header fields in the raw files for GBT and MK for comparison

- SQL_tables_script.txt is a very simple first attempt at a script to setup a mysql database with some relevant fields.

- MKDB is a file that can be loaded into diagrams.net as a visualization for the database structure. Also very much in a nascent stage.
