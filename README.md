# MeerKAT
A repository for my work on MeerKAT

The jupyter-notebooks contain processing of the MeerKAT monitor log output files.

The highest number notebook is the newest and best representation of the data and analysis.

The log files I processed are also provided here as they are required in the same directory for running the notebook code.
