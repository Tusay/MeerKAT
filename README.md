# MeerKAT
A repository for my work on MeerKAT

- The jupyter-notebooks containing processing of the MeerKAT monitor log output files are in the Uptime folder. The highest number notebook is the newest and best representation of the data and analysis, though some of the markdowns may be out of date.

- The outlogs themselves are in the outlogs folder. 

- Work on the database project is in the Database folder. It includes an excel spreadsheet of raw header fields for MK and GBT data products, a MKDB visualization made using diagrams.net, and a very simple mysql script as a starting point for loading a database.
